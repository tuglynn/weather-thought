A blog run on react with a weather widget

[Live App](https://tuglynn.github.io/weather-thought/)

This app was created using React, Firebase and the OpenWeather API.

Project is on going.

Current functionality: a user can enter the name of a city and view the current weather of that city. This is stored in the database.

Any user can read any of the existing blog posts.

A logged in user can edit or delete posts.

##issues

When a user logs in, they are not redirected to the home page.

Any user can delete any posts, not just the ones they were the author of.

The weather is global and not specific to each user.
